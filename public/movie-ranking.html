<h2>The Best of Youth</h2>
<p>This poignant Italian historical drama, directed by Marco Tullio Giordana and written by Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli, captivates me due to its exceptional portrayal of the Carati family's  over crucial decades of Italian history, spanning from 1966 to 2003. The central story focuses on the two brothers, Nicola and Matteo, brilliantly portrayed by Luigi Lo Cascio and Alessio Boni, whose paths diverge as they grow. Additionally, the film cleverly weaves in important political and social events in post-war Italy, adding depth and meaning to the narrative. It's the combination of an emotive storyline and the film's ability to reflect Italy's history in the context of a family that makes "My Best Youth" my favourite film.</p>

<h2>Inside Out</h2>
<p>It's a visually stunning and creatively animated film produced by Pixar. The concept of delving into the inner workings of a young girl's mind and personifying her emotions as characters was a beautiful metaphor that paved the way for our current heightened awareness of the importance of caring for our emotions. It provides a unique perspective on the complexities of human emotions, making it a great film for both children and adults. Moreover, the story's themes about growing up, dealing with change, and understanding one's feelings resonate with me on a personal level.</p>

<h2>Moonlight</h2>
<p>This film, written and directed by Barry Jenkins, is profoundly moving and focuses on the main character's life over three crucial stages: his childhood, adolescence, and the transition to early adulthood. "Moonlight" delves into complex themes like sexuality and identity, and how the main character grapples with these issues amid difficulties, including the physical and emotional abuse he endures as he grows up.</p>
<p>The film is acclaimed for its honest and sensitive approach to these themes, making it a cinematic masterpiece. Furthermore, the three-act narrative allows the viewer to get to know the character deeply over the course of his life, creating a profound emotional connection with the story.</p>
<p>What makes "Moonlight" even more valuable is its ability to touch on the themes of identity and acceptance in a context where structural racism is a reality, both in the United States and around the world. The film provides a poignant reflection on these challenges, resonating deeply in a society grappling with racial inequities.</p>
